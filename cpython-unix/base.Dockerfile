# apt iterates all available file descriptors up to rlim_max and calls
# fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC). This can result in millions of system calls
# (we've seen 1B in the wild) and cause operations to take seconds to minutes.
# Setting a fd limit mitigates.
#
# Attempts at enforcing the limit globally via /etc/security/limits.conf and
# /root/.bashrc were not successful. Possibly because container image builds
# don't perform a login or use a shell the way we expect.
